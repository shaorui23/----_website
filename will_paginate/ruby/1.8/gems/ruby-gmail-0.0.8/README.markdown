## Description

A Rubyesque interface to Gmail, with all the tools you'll need. Search, read and send multipart emails; archive, mark as read/unread, delete emails; and manage labels.

## Features

* Search emails
* Read emails (handles attachments)
* Emails: Label, archive, delete, mark as read/unread/spam
* Create and delete labels
* Create and send multipart email messages in plaintext and/or html, with inline images and attachments
* Utilizes Gmail's IMAP & SMTP, MIME-type detection and parses and generates MIME properly.

## Problems:

* May not correctly read malformed MIME messages. This could possibly be corrected by having IMAP parse the MIME structure.
* Cannot grab the plain or html message without also grabbing attachments. It might be nice to lazy-[down]load attachments.

## Example Code:

    require 'gmail'
    gmail = Gmail.new(username, password) do |g|
      read_count = g.inbox.count(:read) # => .count take the same arguments as .emails
      unread = g.inbox.emails(:unread)
      unread[0].archive!
      unread[1].delete!
      unread[2].move_to('FunStuff') # => labels and removes from inbox
      unread[3].message # => a MIME::Message, parsed from the email body
      unread[3].mark(:read)
      unread[3].message.attachments.length
      unread[4].label('FunStuff') # => Just adds the label 'FunStuff'
      unread[4].message.save_attachments_to('path/to/save/into')
      unread[5].message.attachments[0].save_to_file('path/to/save/into')
      unread[6].mark(:spam)
    end

    # Optionally use a block like above to have the gem automatically login and logout,
    # or just use it without a block after creating the object like below, and it will
    # automatically logout at_exit. The block method is recommended in order to limit
    # your signed-in session.

    older = gmail.inbox.emails(:after => '2009-03-04', :before => '2009-03-15')
    todays_date = Time.parse(Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
    yesterday = gmail.inbox.emails(:after => (todays_date - 24*60*60), :before => todays_date)
    todays_unread = gmail.inbox.emails(:unread, :after => todays_date)
  
    new_email = MIME::Message.generate
    new_email.to "email@example.com"
    new_email.subject "Having fun in Puerto Rico!"
    plain, html = new_email.generate_multipart('text/plain', 'text/html')
    plain.content = "Text of plain message."
    html.content = "<p>Text of <em>html</em> message.</p>"
    new_email.attach_file('some_image.dmg')
    gmail.send_email(new_email)
